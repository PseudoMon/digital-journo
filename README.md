# Digital Journo

Digital Journo is a HTML/CSS design for a blog/microblog. It's perfectly suited for blogs with short daily posts. Each post can be given extra information that can acts as status, such as what you're reading or what you're listening to when you write the post.

It's made with HTML and CSS, with a tiny bit of Javascript for the archive links. Its CSS is made with [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/).

This repo only contains the basic template for a site, and as such, not immediately usable. If you want to use it, please contact [me](https://github.com/PseudoMon) and I can help you set it up.
